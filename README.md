This is gonna be slow. I'm gonna work on it whenever my brain decides it's time again.\
So maybe every 3 Months. Maybe.

This is a minecraft mod made by @Wurstkatze.\
The goal is to get loud sirens. With a long reach.\
I haven't found any mod that adds a good factory alarm for my create mod stuff.

## Development

To test the mod, run the `runClient` task from gradle.
